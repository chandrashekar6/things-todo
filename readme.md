# What Should I do in the Summmer ? ü§î

Hi everyone, If you have no clue what you will do after the first 4 exciting days at home, we have come up with a bunch of interesting things you could try out.


## I have no idea what to do üòê

### Start with these things:

* Check out what comes inside Computer Science by watching this video [Map of Computer Science](https://youtu.be/SzJ46YA_RaA). \[Bonus: [Map of Mathematics](https://youtu.be/OmJ-4B-mS-Y) \]

* Install a Linux based OS ([Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop),[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)) on your laptop and learn how to operate Linux based Operating Systems.

* Make it a point that whatever(yes!! literally everything) you do in your computer you do it through command line. Even when it comes to copying, moving or renaming files. Refrain from using file explorers and GUI clients until you really get a firm grip on Linux commands.

* Make a Github Account **(Very Important)**.

* Install and Learn how to use GIT from [here](https://git-scm.com/) **(Very Important)**.

## I want to learn a new (computer) language, But I don't know which one üôÑ

* You need to learn at least five languages by the time you pass out of college. Some really good languages both for competitive programming (mainly for object oriented programming) and web development are: 

	* **Learn C++**: [Here](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/01-introduction-to-these-tutorials/)

	* **Learn how to use STL with C++**: [Here](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/)

	* **Python**: [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

	* **Javascript** [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) and [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) is embedding JS into web pages

	* **Java**: 
		* [Part 1](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/) and [Part 2](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-2/) (A good introduction to Object Oriented Programming Concepts)
		* [Official Java Tutorials by Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

	* **Golang**: [Here](https://golang.org/)

	* **Rust**: [Here](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) (Mainly for system programming languages and device drivers. Check it out if you're interested and read the documentation.)

## I would like to learn how to make a website üë®‚Äçüé®

* Start with [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)
It is the best place for starting web development.

* Learn how to make a website with a FrontEnd Framework (Angular JS, React JS, Vue JS).

* Learn Django - a web framework in python if you are a fan of [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and [pythonic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean) cultures.
	[CodingEntrepreneurs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEsfXFp6DpzQFqfCur9CJ4QnKQTVXUsRy) is an awesome youtube channel to get started with django.


## I would like to develop a Mobile App üì±

* Learn android app development using Kotlin or Java. [This](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1q3ROAofjeOUwh7lPBnGbg__DUodwLN7) is a great place to start. The guy explains both theory and practicals with the right balance.

* Check out [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/). This will get you up and running very quickly. It uses a language called Lua which is very similar to python as the base.

* Also this is [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) for you python aficionados. Do give it a quick visit.

* For ios/android development, check out [Flutter](https://flutter.io/). Has a differnet approach to front end unlike others. Follows reactive design principle. (Like ReactJS). Is programmed in Dart (similar to c, Object oriented and easy to pick up). Made by google. And builds both ios/android app from just one code. Here's how to [Get Started](https://flutter.io/get-started/).

* Learn Swift for iOS app development.

* For Cross platform app development use React Native.


## I would like to know how to store Large amounts of Data üóÑ

* Learn about database system like MySQL or MongoDB.

* Learn how to use MongoDB or MySQL and interface it with some language like C++ or JavaScript.

* Learn how data centers and large data clusters work.


## I would like to improve my general logic and coding abilities that will help me in interviews ‚öî

* Try solving atleast 2 problems a day from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) / [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) / [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/).

* Try Learning more about Data Structures and implement them in at least one language.

* There are a lot of "learn the language" domains like [this](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=python) one for python on hackerrank. They are also Really good for practice.

## I am just generally interested in the exploring the world of CS üî≠

* Explore stuff from [Github Explore](https://github.com/explore).

* Look at [this](https://www.javascriptstuff.com/articles/) blog for more on JS and ReactJS.

  * [The Well Known TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/)

  * [The Next Web](https://techcrunch.com/)

  * [The Medium](https://medium.com/topic/technology)

  

## I'd like to read a few books on CS this summer 

* [Here](https://github.com/cs-books/influential-cs-books) is a comprehensive list of cs books that everyone should definitely read.

* Try Reading [CLRS](https://www.amazon.in/Introduction-Algorithms-3e-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844), you can easily get a pdf online.

* These are places where you can get any programming book you will ever need for free !!!
	* [Github repo for free CS books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md)
	* [AllItEbooks.in](http://www.allitebooks.in/)


## I'd like to try out some game development üéÆ

* If you like developing Games try out [Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) or [UnReal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4).

* If you are interested to develop some Augmented Reality, [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/) (used along with unity) is for you!

## Anything else I can do ?

* Learn how to use APIs (All the Google Applications like Drive, Calendar, Contacts, YouTube are mostly on GitHub).

  * For example, try accessing or downloading your drive files through your command line and try printing your liked videos from YouTube by using their APIs. 

  * You can imagine anything more you want and play around with them which in turn gives motivation.

* Sign up for [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get some sweet goodies (like free private repositories on github).

* Check out [GSOC (Google Summer of Code)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about/) and what is it about. Wikipedia link: [Google Summer of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code)

* The above two are related. So check out both of them.
* [Docker Ebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwV9gSjgkJWna2VmZms4cTNJaXM/view?usp=sharing) Please try out and practice. Hit the command line.
* [MainFlux IoT](https://www.mainflux.com/)
* [ThingsBoard IoT](https://thingsboard.io/)
* Both of the above IoT platform are used extensively in startups.
* [Rancher OS](https://rancher.com/rancher-os/) (The OS itself is completely dockerized and so are all of its services.)
* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/home/explore) It is not a technology but a tech community platform where developers help each other just like Stack Overflow but faster help given.

## Some motivation so that you don't think you're a piece of **** This is for people who can listen to this and won't get bored immediately.
* Read a lot. Read large amounts of documentation. There are two types of intelligence. 1. Technical. 2. Functional.
* Always go for Functional. Technical intelligence is "you do it when you're given a task. You somehow find out a way of achieving it. Like a robot."
* Functional is when "you know why you're doing it. In that way you find out ways of optimising stuff and improving.
* Go deep into the mechanisms of anything. Fingertip understanding. One thing I personally found out after years of being in fear was "Nothing will happen to your computer machine. If something goes wrong you can always re-install anything." You just gotta have some ISOs in hand when stuff goes crazy.
* Read more than you do. The worst part of implementing anthing or trying out new technologies is reading the official documentation. But cold coal doesn't give you ironed clothes. You have to work hard in order to live an extra ordinary life.

## What you should not do this summer üö≠ üöØ üìµ üîû

 - [x] Don't waste your time binge-watching a TV series.

 - [x] If you go to youtube to see a video, then don't click on the suggested videos after that, it will take you into an infinte spiral of endless entertainment. Disable autoplay.
